Welcome weary traveler, you just stumbled out of the forest into this small village.

You can see no humans, only lots of dogs all happy to see you!

A fluffy golder retriever walks up to you wagging its tail and sits at your feet.

What would you like to do to it?

Enter 1 to pet his head and 2 to boop his nose.


You have chosen to boop his nose!

He grunts and stops wagging his tail.

He still sits at your feet but doesn't seem to be as interested in you anymore.

After seeing your interaction with the golden retriever, the other dogs start to make their way over to you.

You count 7 total, each a different breed.

What would you like to do?

Enter 1 to run away and 2 to pet them all.


You have chosen to pet them all!

It takes a bit of time to give them all an equal amount of pets, but you did it.

They seem to love you even more now!

The golden retriever barks at you.

He seems to be saying that he wants you to follow him.

What would you like to do?

Enter 1 to follow him and 2 to sit down and rest.


You have chosen to sit down and rest!

You fall into a slumber and when you awake you see you are in a new place next to a pile of treasure.

It's not a pile of gold and jewels, but instead a pile of dog treats.

You are hungry and decide to snack on some of the dog treats.

There's jerky and dog bone treats.

What would you like to do?

Enter 1 to eat the jerky treat and 2 to eat the dog bone treat.


You have chosen to eat the dog bone treat!

You pass out and wake up in the middle of a forest!

You decide to look for a nearby village for help.
